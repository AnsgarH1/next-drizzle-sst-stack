# Nextjs + Drizzle + SST Stack

This project is a POC for a full-stack Next.js web application using Drizzle with AWS RDS configured with SST. It aims to provide a simple solution hosted entirely on AWS to reduce dependencies on hosting providers like vercel and co. This project was inspired by Theo Browne's recent video demonstrating the "new" T3 stack. (05/2024)
